# World before Agile and Scrum
 ### Waterfall Model

1. Analysis
2. Requirements specification
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing and integration
6. Operation and Maintenance

Industry standard for software projects for decades.

 #### Flaws

* Changing requirements affect the deadline
* Defects/bugs found too late
* People pinching delays progress
# Birth of Agile
* 24 hours (daily cycles)
* 30 days (sprint cycle)
* Potentially Shippable Product Increment

Each cycle contains mini phases of the waterfall model. This allows business __realese a few features early__, and make some early __return of investment__. You can discover potential issues early, change requirements often and __react to change through replanning__. Lightweight / simple solutions.

 #### Object Mentor (00s) - Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others to do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

* Individuals and interactions OVER processes and tools
* Working software OVER comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration OVER contract negotiation
* Responding to change OVER following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items of the right, we value the items on the left more.
