# World before Agile and Scrum
 ### Waterfall Model

1. Analysis
2. Requirements specification
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing and integration
6. Operation and Maintenance

Industry standard for software projects for decades.

 #### Flaws

* Changing requirements affect the deadline
* Defects/bugs found too late
* People pinching delays progress
# Birth of Agile
* 24 hours (daily cycles)
* 30 days (sprint cycle)
* Potentially Shippable Product Increment

Each cycle contains mini phases of the waterfall model. This allows business __realese a few features early__, and make some early __return of investment__. You can discover potential issues early, change requirements often and __react to change through replanning__. Lightweight / simple solutions.

 #### Object Mentor (00s) - Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others to do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

* Individuals and interactions OVER processes and tools
* Working software OVER comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration OVER contract negotiation
* Responding to change OVER following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items of the right, we value the items on the left more.
# Scrum Intro
__Self Organising Cross Functional Teams__. A project manager does not control since their expertise empowers them to make decisions collectivily. The team works in iterations, which allows the business the flexibility to change its requirements, and the development team the certainty they need to deliver a working piece of the product (__Potentially Shippable Product Increment__).

> Framework for developing and sustaining complex products

> Framework within which people can address complex adaptative problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value

Developed by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.

 ### Scrum Theory

Based on __Empirical Process Control Theory__
* Iterative
* Incremental

> Scrum is founded on Empirical Process Control Theory, or Empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.

Consist of __3 principles__
1. __TRANSPARENCY__ -- open and honest as a team (done means done)
2. __INSPECTION__ -- commonly done at the end of the sprint, thus setting the sprint length is really important (check on progress)
3. __ADAPTATION__ (change thre product based on inspection)

Key points:
* Deliveing often
* Not the answer to EVERY problem.
    * Example: TDD
* Empirical Process Control Theory
    * Learn from past mistakes
    * Improving
    * Making new decisions
    * Making changes (adapting)

> Scrum is not a process or a technique for building products, rather, it is a framework whitin which you can employ various processes and techniques

 #### Increment

Inremental deliveries of "Done" product ensure a potentially useful version of working product is always available.

Key points:
* A working increment is delivered each sprint
* A piece of the product is 'done', according to the team definition of 'done'
* Includes 'rules' defined by team -- correctly tested products
* Design standards met

---

 ### Scrum Skeleton

* Product Backlog -- As prioritized by Product Owner
    * Sprint Backlog -- list of features and their acceptence criteria (subset of backlog)
* Backlog tasks expanded by team
* Daily Scrum Meeting
* Potentiall Releasable Product Increment

> Sprint is an iteration of a calendar month or less in which a product increment is delivered

---

 ### Scrum Event

Scrum prescribes __four formal events__ (timeboxes) for inspection and adaptation.

* Sprint Planning
* Daily Scrum
* Sprint Review
* Sprint Retrospetive

If you take away one of these, __you are not doing Scrum__. You can add events on top of them.

---

 ### Scrum Values

* Commitment
* Courage
* Focus
* Openness
* Respect

When the values of commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life and build trust for everyone. The Scrum Team members learn and explore those values as they work with the Scrum events, roles and artifacts.

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values. People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team. The Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems. Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work. Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.
# Scrum Team Roles
Simplifies down to only 3 roles whithin the __Scrum Team__.

 #### Scrum Master

> The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.

* Expert on the Scrum Rules (Go-To Person for Scrum framework knowledege)
* Remove team impediments (Blockers)
* Help the team to self organise
* Facilities meetings or whatever neccesary
* Helps the _Product Owner_ maximize R.O.I (Return of Investment)
* Helps the Team to be as productive as possible and deliver Product Increment

The Scrum Master is a __servant-leader__ for the Scrum Team. Serving the team, means you're leading the team. Removing impediments to the Development Team's progress.

 #### Product Owner

> Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team.

* Responsible for creating the _Product Backlog_
* Prioritise requirements based on business value
* Make decisions to maximise R.O.I
* Make trade-offs to maximise product value

Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the _Product Backlog_, which includes

* Clearly expressing Product Backlog items
* Ordering the items to best achieve goals and missions

For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions

 #### Development Team

> Development Teams consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasble Increment of 'Done' product at the end of each Sprint

* Build potentially releasable product increment
* Dev team is one of the three scrum team roles
* Self organising & collaborative
* Multi-skilled as needed for the project
    * Designers, UX, Tests and Developers working together!
* Scrum KEY: Dev teams are __Experts__ in their field instead of resources
* They look at Scrum Master for removing of impediments and coaching
* They look at Product Owner for clear requirements, prioritization, and trade-off calls
* Optimum team size (small for communication), usually between 3 and 9

Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members other than Developer, regardless of the work being performed by the person, there are no exceptions to this rule.
# Scrum Events
Events/Time-boxes and Rules

Prescribed events are used in Scrum to __create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined__ in Scrum. All events are time-boxed events, such that every event has a maximum duration.

> The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box or period of time less than a calendar month, in which the team delivers a product increasement. A new sprint starts immediatly after the conclusion of another one.

Failure to include any of these events results in greatly reduced transparency and is a lost opportunity to inspect and adapt. If you're not doing ALL these events, you're not doing Scrum.

* Sprint Planning
* Daily Scrum
* Sprint Review
* Sprint Retrospective

Unofficial:
* Release Planning

 #### Key Points

* Set time for a task for maximum productivity and deliverability
* Trying to minimize the need for other meetings
    * Scrum provides the minimum set of meetings necesary to make sure that the Team has inspected on their progress, adapted, planned and though of everything they needed to to deliver that product increment. The idea is to remove the impediments to the team.
* Maximum duration for every event
* Observe time taken over planning (Scrum is very explicit about time boxes)
* Only Product Owner has authority to cancel a sprint
* Work out how much time the development team have (__Capacity__) -- take meetings into account
* Time available - Factored unavaiable time = __Capacity__ (Builds __BUFFER__ into the plan)
    * 5 working days, 1 day for planning & other unavailable time = 4 days capacity
    * 10 working day, 1 day for planning = 9 days capacity
* Sprint goal is an objective that's met through implementation of Product Backlog

---

 ## Events

 ### Sprint Planning Meeting

* Team plan the work for the sprint.
* 4 hours meeting for a 2 week sprint -- 8 for a month
* 2 topics
    * __WHAT__ needs to be done
    * __HOW__ the work will get done
* Lots to cover, so have breaks

__What__: Product Owner exposes and explains a __Proposed List of features__ (subset of _Product Backlog_). The development team ask questions and eventually pick features they believe they can commit to.

__How__: The development team breaks histories in subtasks and estimate them. They're deciding the work and how they will deliver the product increment.

 ### Daily Scrum

* Daily meeting, no more than __15 minutes__.
* Development team answer the following questions:
    * What did I do yestarday that helped the Team meet the Sprint Goal?
    * What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
    * Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal
* The Sprit __Backlog and Burndown__ should be visible to draw atention to the team progress or see any impediments.
* Held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity
* The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, but the Development Team is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum

 ### Sprint Review

Meeting held at the end of the sprint and allows the team to demo the increment of the product to the Product Owner and Stakeholders (CEO, Customer, Final Product Vendor, Director/Head of department, etc...). They can make suggestions to the Product Owner that makes notes to adapt the Product Backlog, this will be adapted and the stories updated based on the output from the Sprint Review and the demo.

* Stakeholders review from previous sprint & add input to next sprint
* __4 hours MAXIMUM time-box__


 ### Sprint Retrospective

Meeting held after the Sprint Review and before next Sprint. __90 HOURS__ for 2 week sprint.

Each team member answers the following questions:
* What worked this sprint?
* What could be improved in the next sprint?

This would be the usual format but aren't necesarily held this way. This is a chance for the team to __inspect and adapt__.

---

 ### Release Planning Meeting
Not officialy a Scrum event but often used in scrum. Product backlog Items prioritised for release (subset of Product backlog).

Team agree what is feasible for release, but as an indicator NOT as a commitment. This can be used to calculate __Team velocity__, used to predict how many features will be completed by a release date, or when scope is likely to be delivered for scope-driven projects.
# Scrum Artefacts
Each artifact help us deliver or track the product.

> Scrum's artifacts represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaption. Artifacts defined by Scrum are specifically designed to maximize transparency of key information so that everybody has the same undestanding of the artifact.

 ### Product Backlog

Set of features the Product Owner desired to see in the final product. This adapts over time. PO maintains the backlog, and works with the Stakeholders to form the requirements, and the development team for technican income and estimates. Since a Product Backlog contains features that affects the product lifecycle as the release.

The PO is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.

__Product Backlog REFINEMENT__ is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog.

Scrum Master and Dev Team, should disculss KEY points with PO and gain undestanding of upcoming features.

Make sure that ITEMS are READY for planning. That means __stories are clear to the team and small enough to be completed in one sprint using the team's definition of DONE__.

__SHOULD BE VISIBLE TO ALL TO SHOW PROGRESS__

 #### Prioritizing the Product Backlog

* Higher ordered Prodct Backlog items are usually clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones.

* Higher priority items are the tasks to be worked on next

* Break items down into smaller managable chunks

* Clarify acceptance criteria

* Refinement leads to higher priority items become clearer

--- 


 ### Release Backlog & Burndown

Not officially a scrum artefact but often used in Scrum. Relase backlog is a subset of the Product Backlog.
Release Burndown is a common process to monitor progress, it shows the number of Story Points remaining to release. It makes it easy to see if a project is on the right track.

---

 ### Sprint Backlog and burdown

Subset of Release backlog with sub tasks, initially picked by the PO but finally commited to by the development team. It consists of features tasks, subtask and their estimations. The Sprint burndown (tasks done and remaining) helps the team monitor the sprint status, and allows the team to monitor the tasks remaining in the sprint backlog.

> "As a <Role> I want <Requirement> so that <Reason/ROI>"

> The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. Includes Product Backlog items in a Sprint, plus a plan for delivering a Product Increment and realizing the Sprint goal.

__Frozen Sprint Backlog__: Only the Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog durint a Sprint. PO should negotiatie with the team and viceversa on sprint changes.

__SHOULD BE VISIBLE TO ALL TO SHOW PROGRESS__

---

 ### Releasable Product Increment

Functionality delivered by the team each sprint. Meets definition of done (and quality standards).

 #### Definition of Done

If the definition of "done" for an increment is part of the conventions, standards or guidelines of the development organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If "done" for an increment is __not__ a convention of the development organization, the Development Team of the Scrum Team must define a definition of "done" appropiate for the product. If there are multiple Scrum Teams working on the system or product release, development teams must mutually define the definition of "Done".

* Shared understanding of DONE is Key in Scrum
* Development Team decide "definition of DONE" but bear in mind departmental standards
* Multiple Teams (e.g. and back and front) should mutually agree on definition of DONE
# Scrum of Scrums

The scrum of scrums is a meeting held to co-ordinate a set of inter-related scrum teams. The power and ability to scale is in the fact that one representative from each related team attends the scrum of scrums meeting. By doing this an organisation can co-ordinate hundreds of people on different teams.

The illustration shows four related scrum teams. From each team, a representative has been picked to attend the meeting. The representatives are shown sharing knowledge in the centre of the illustration.

Once the number of members in the scrum of scrums becomes to large a representative from that meeting can join another scrum of scrums meeting and the process can continue.

In this meeting, the host asks four questions (in the same vein as the daily scrum meeting). The questions are:
1. What have you accomplished since the last meeting
2. What do you aim to accomplish before the next
meeting
3. Are there any impediments/blockers in your way
4. Are you about to do anything that could create a blocker/impediment to the project

The first three questions aim to highlight progress, draw attention to targets and surface any issues that need to be addressed to keep the project on track. The last question stems from the fact that related projects can often unknowingly create problems for each other.
