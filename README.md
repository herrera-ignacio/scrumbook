# World before Agile and Scrum
 ### Waterfall Model

1. Analysis
2. Requirements specification
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing and integration
6. Operation and Maintenance

Industry standard for software projects for decades.

 #### Flaws

* Changing requirements affect the deadline
* Defects/bugs found too late
* People pinching delays progress
# Birth of Agile
* 24 hours (daily cycles)
* 30 days (sprint cycle)
* Potentially Shippable Product Increment

Each cycle contains mini phases of the waterfall model. This allows business __realese a few features early__, and make some early __return of investment__. You can discover potential issues early, change requirements often and __react to change through replanning__. Lightweight / simple solutions.

 #### Object Mentor (00s) - Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others to do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

* Individuals and interactions OVER processes and tools
* Working software OVER comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration OVER contract negotiation
* Responding to change OVER following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items of the right, we value the items on the left more.
# Scrum Intro
__ Self Organising Cross Functional Teams__. A project manager does not control since their expertise empowers them to make decisions collectivily. The team works in iterations, which allows the business the flexibility to change its requirements, and the development team the certainty they need to deliver a working piece of the product (_Potentially Shippable Product Increment_).

> Framework for developing and sustaining complex products

> Framework within which people can address complex adaptative problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value

Developed by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.

 ### Scrum Theory

Based on __Empirical Process Control Theory__
* Iterative
* Incremental

> Scrum is founded on Empirical Process Control Theory, or Empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.

Consist of __3 principles__
1. Transparency -- open and honest as a team (done means done)
2. Inspection -- commonly done at the end of the sprint, thus setting the sprint length is really important (check on progress)
3. Adaptation (change thre product based on inspection)

Key points:
* Deliveing often
* Not the answer to EVERY problem.
    * Example: TDD
* Empirical Process Control Theory
    * Learn from past mistakes
    * Improving
    * Making new decisions
    * Making changes (adapting)

> Scrum is not a process or a technique for building products, rather, it is a framework whitin which you can employ various processes and techniques

 #### Increment

Inremental deliveries of "Done" product ensure a potentially useful version of working product is always available.

Key points:
* A working increment is delivered each sprint
* A piece of the product is 'done', according to the team definition of 'done'
* Includes 'rul'es defined by team -- correctly tested products
* Design standards met

---

 ### Scrum Skeleton

* Product Backlog -- As prioritized by Product Owner
    * Sprint Backlog -- list of features and their acceptence criteria (subset of backlog)
* Backlog tasks expanded by team
* Daily Scrum Meeting
* Potentiall Releasable Product Increment

> Sprint is an iteration of a calendar month or less in which a product increment is delivered

---

 ### Scrum Event

Scrum prescribes __four formal events__ (timeboxes) for inspection and adaptation.

* Sprint Planning
* Daily Scrum
* Sprint Review
* Sprint Retrospetive

If you take away one of these, __you are not doing Scrum__. You can add events on top of them.

---

 ### Scrum Values

* Commitment
* Courage
* Focus
* Openness
* Respect

When the values of commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life and build trust for everyone. The Scrum Team members learn and explore those values as they work with the Scrum events, roles and artifacts.

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values. People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team. The Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems. Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work. Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.
# Scrum Team Roles
Simplifies down to only 3 roles whithin the __Scrum Team__.

 #### Scrum Master

> The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.

* Expert on the Scrum Rules (Go-To Person for Scrum framework knowledege)
* Remove team impediments (Blockers)
* Help the team to self organise
* Facilities meetings or whatever neccesary
* Helps the _Product Owner_ maximize R.O.I (Return of Investment)
* Helps the Team to be as productive as possible and deliver Product Increment

The Scrum Master is a __servant-leader__ for the Scrum Team. Serving the team, means you're leading the team. Removing impediments to the Development Team's progress.

 #### Product Owner

> Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team.

* Responsible for creating the _Product Backlog_
* Prioritise requirements based on business value
* Make decisions to maximise R.O.I
* Make trade-offs to maximise product value

Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the _Product Backlog_, which includes

* Clearly expressing Product Backlog items
* Ordering the items to best achieve goals and missions

For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions

 #### Development Team

> Development Teams consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasble Increment of 'Done' product at the end of each Sprint

* Build potentially releasable product increment
* Dev team is one of the three scrum team roles
* Self organising & collaborative
* Multi-skilled as needed for the project
    * Designers, UX, Tests and Developers working together!
* Scrum KEY: Dev teams are __Experts__ in their field instead of resources
* They look at Scrum Master for removing of impediments and coaching
* They look at Product Owner for clear requirements, prioritization, and trade-off calls
* Optimum team size (small for communication), usually between 3 and 9

Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members other than Developer, regardless of the work being performed by the person, there are no exceptions to this rule.
